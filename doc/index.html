                 <h4>About</h4>

                 <p>"AndroidAdapters" is an Android-library, which provides feature-rich adapter implementations for providing the underlying data of widgets such as <tt>ListView</tt>, <tt>GridView</tt>, <tt>ExpandableListView</tt> and <tt>RecyclerView</tt>.</p>

                 <p>The aim of this documentation is to offer an overview of the project's source code and to explain, how the interface, which is provided by the library, can be used and how the underlying implementations are supposed to work.</p>            

                <p>The library provides the following features:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The library provides generic adapter implementations for providing the underlying data of <tt>ListView</tt>, <tt>GridView</tt>, <tt>ExpandableListView</tt> and <tt>RecyclerView</tt> widgets.</li>
                    <li>An extensive API for modifying the underlying data of an adapter is provided.</li>
                    <li>The adapters provide built-in support for enabling/disabling items. Furthermore, different states can be assigned to individual items.</li>
                    <li>A simple API for sorting the items of an adapter is provided by the library.</li>
                    <li>The items of all adapters can be easily filtered by applying multiple queries.</li>
                    <li>The library supports different selection modes. E.g. adapters, which allow to only select one item at once or adapters, which allow multiple items to be selected at the same time.</li>
                    <li>In order to visualize the items of an adapter, the library takes care of inflating views and uses a built-in `ViewHolder` pattern.</li>
                    <li>Operations on the adapters can be observed by using a wide variety of listeners and by using Android's logging framework.</li>
                </ul>
